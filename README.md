## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

***  


* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:

	* Uses a web manifest
	
	* Uses a service worker for offline functionality
	
	* Is installable

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 20.

You should also consider the following suggestions to help your project stand out:

Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:

* Look into the concept of **CSS-in-JS**, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

* Try using a component library, such as [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

* Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose&mdash;it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.

Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

**More details about the project will be provided in the lessons for Module 23 in Canvas.**
